# ABOUT

I coded and deployed an Ethereum smart contract with an interactive web app using Solidity and React amongst 200+ developers during a two-week sprint.
As a Buildspace learn-a-thon, there was a live "kick-off" showcasing an intro to the project scope. There were scheduled, hour-long coworking sessions
where lo-fi beats played as we indivdually worked alongside the developer community.

# USE CASE

For my project, I created a movie portal. Users can send me prompted movie recommendations on the blockchain by connecting their Metamask wallet to 
the free Rinkeby testnet. Once the user's Metamask wallet is connected to the web app, the movie portal is enabled and movie recommendations from
other users can be seen!
