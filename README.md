# Movie App

This is a buildspace project.

During a 2-week learn-a-thon, I wrote an Ethereum smart contract, deployed the smart contract to the blockchain, 
and created a user dApp that interacts with the smart contract; allowing users to send me movie recommendations.

I earned an NFT for being a part of the first 200 people to complete the sprint.
